                <p>

                  ability to source and distribute medicines all over the world
                  is what makes us different to pharmaceutical wholesalers who
                  only serve their domestic markets. We exist to make sure a
                  healthcare professional with a patient in need, anywhere in
                  the world, can always get the right medicine for their
                  individual patient – quickly, easily and safely whether
                  licensed or unlicensed.

                  In some countries it is not permissible to promote the use of

                <p>A medicine is considered unlicensed if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    it is an innovative product which has not yet been approved
                    anywhere, or

                  <li>
                    It has been approved in at least one country, but not yet in
                    your country, or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It was once licensed in your country, but has since been

                </ul>

                  Many countries have formal regulatory pathways to allow access
                  to medicines in this scenario. The use of unlicensed medicines
                  is not illegal, but they should only be accessed where
                  licensed alternatives are unavailable or unsuitable.

                  There are four reasons we may not be able to sell a medicine
                  listed on Clinigen Direct in your country:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    If a licensed equivalent is available, your national health
                    authority is unlikely to allow you to import an unlicensed
                    medicine.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When we are an authorised distributor of a medicine, our
                    distribution agreement may be restricted to certain
                    countries. If we know the authorised distributor in your
                    country, we will refer you to them. If we are not aware of a
                    distributor in your country, we will contact the product
                    owner on your behalf to see whether supply can be arranged
                    on an exceptional basis.

                  <li>
                    The medicine may be part of a Managed Access Program -
                    sometimes known as an Early Access Program, Special Access
                    Program or Compassionate Use Program - in which case your
                    patient will need to meet specific eligibility criteria
                    designed by the Program Sponsor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The medicine listed may not be approved by any regulatory
                    body and the legislation in your country may not permit the
                    import of a globally unlicensed medicine.

                </h5>
                <p>
                  The price of a medicine is often set on a country-by-country
                  or region-by-region basis. We work to strict quality standards
                  when sourcing unlicensed medicines and will always ask if you
                  need a pack to come from a specific country or region. If you
                  do not have a preference about the origin of the pack, we will
                  present you with options which still meet our quality
                  standards.

                <p>
                  Clinigen has a responsibility to ensure that any locations
                  receiving medicinal products are officially authorised by
                  their local governing body. Clinigen customer services will
                  identify that a location due to receive medicinal products is
                  qualified to do so by either validating against a
                  government-controlled website, or by being in receipt of a
                  copy of the hospital operating licence.

                  When documentation is readily available, it takes
                  approximately one day to validate a hospital/receiving site
                  and setup a new account, although this process can be
                  expedited in emergency situations.

                  Each country holds its own appropriate equivalent of what we
                  refer to as a licence to hold and dispense/store and
                  distribute medication, or ‘to practice medicine’. Providing
                  this documentation when placing your first order will ensure
                  your request is completed within the expected timeline. If you
                  are not aware of the specific requirements in your country,
                  our customer services team will be happy to help. We will also
