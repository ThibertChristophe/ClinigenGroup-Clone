                <h3>Bryan O'Farrell Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust</h3>
                <p>
                  Bryan is the Lead Pharmacist for Critical Care & Theatres at
                  the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, a COVID-19 surge
                  centre. Bryan and the pharmacy team at the Royal Free have
                  transformed the delivery of the ICU pharmacy service and
                  played a vital role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>

                        Bryan and his team, working across the Royal Free and
                        Barnet hospitals, were pushed to their limits during the
                        first wave of COVID-19, with units and bed capacity
                        doubling to meet demand, and then nearly tripling during
                        the second wave.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In order to continue to treat those patients, and
                        support the medical and nursing teams looking after
                        them, they had to effectively transform their entire
                        service delivery. The main driver behind this was
                        patient safety, but also to support nurse and medics
                        working alongside them.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Jennifer Morris at the Royal Free, and Lisa Folan at
                        Barnet Hospital played a key role in this, creating
                        stock lists, supplying medicines, sourcing storage
                        cupboards and fridges and labelling for ease of use.
                        Daily stock checks were required to manage the sheer
                        volume of medicines being used, and alternative regimens
                        and strategy were planned and communicated to prepare
                        for any drug shortages that might occur.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        A seven-day rota with extended hours was also
                        implemented to ensure the team were available at all
                        times. In addition, the team took on a number of roles
                        to ease pressure on nurses and medics, including
                        introducing pre-filled syringes, setting up monitoring
                        systems, and supporting clinical trials across the
                        units, amongst numerous others.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Despite challenges from all directions, including the
                        workload, drug shortages, working in PPE, the toll on
                        patients, and the effects all of this had on staff
                        morale, the team were outstanding in dealing with the
                        pressure – and were able to deliver for their patients
                        when they needed it most.

                        As a young graduate, while still resident at a pharmacy,
                        Thomas had the original idea to compare the efficacy and
                        safety between the reference rituximab and one of its
                        biosimilars in Multiple Sclerosis.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The efficacy and the safety of rituximab's biosimilar
                        had never been tested in this indication. He led a
                        multidisciplinary team made up of neurologists and
                        pharmacists, who demonstrated for the first time a
                        similarity in this indication, which will allow a safer
                        and wider use of this biosimilar, and better access to
                        treatment for patients in low-income countries.

                      <p>
                        In addition to this, his work was published in a
                        prestigious neurology journal with an impact factor
                        rarely reached by pharmacists (IF=5).

                        With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many treatments
                        in other clinical areas were delayed or stopped to

                        They helped to establish a more efficient routine for

                        extremely useful for both patients and staff alike.
                        Whereas they would usually see patients receiving
                        chemotherapy in independent pharmacy clinics, they
                        switched seamlessly to virtual consultations to ensure
                        support for these patients continued, in addition to
                        contacting those in need of supportive medications, or
                        who had become confused with medication regimens.

                        They set up a satellite clinic, to allow patients to
                        come in and receive treatment without having to walk
                        through the main hospital building where COVID treatment
                        was taking place, helping to alleviate a stressful
                        situation for vulnerable patients. They also provided
                        support to the Haematology Consultant on ward rounds, as
                        well as visiting other wards, to ensure patients had a
